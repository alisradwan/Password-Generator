## Description

I created this password generator to display my JavaScript skills. This website, when the user clicks the "Generate Password" button will display a series of prompts to the user. The user can select the length of the password between 8 and 128 characters and can choose characters of uppercase, lowercase, numbers or symbols.

## What I learned

I learned many important fundementals of javascript creating this project. I used a combination of objects, arrays, function calls, while statements and if statements. I learned how to call functions, return values and many different manipulations that can be performed on objects, arrays and numbers like Math.Floor, Math.random and isFinite. I also learned commonly used operators like ! and ===. I really enjoyed my time learning and creating this project!
